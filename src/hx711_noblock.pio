; This program pulls a 32-bit integer from application code and uses
; it to set the gain on the HX711. If an integer is not provided, the
; previously provided integer is used. A default integer of 0
; corresponding to a gain of 128 is used until an integer is provided.
; The integer provided should be in the range 0 to 2, inclusive.
; 
; This program constantly and automatically refills the ISR with the
; newest value from the HX711 without providing a gain value from
; application code.
; 
; The lower 24 bits contain the value from the HX711. The next (upper)
; bits should all be 0, but in any case should be ignored by
; application code.
; 
; Details are given on page 5 of the HX711's datasheet.
; 
; NOTES:
; 1. This program assumes the state machine is running at 1MHz.
; 
; 2. When running in serial, there is an overlap between T2 and T3-T4.
; That is to say, the data pin can be read from 0.1us after the clock
; pin has gone high. Given each bit is read in serial, the T2 delay is
; not needed.
; 
; 3. The 'x' register is used to store the last count of bits to read
; and to preload the OSR with if the OSR is empty. See pg. 350 of the
; RP2040 datasheet for details about this when the 'noblock' option is
; given.
;
; 4. The 'y' register is used to as the decrement counter for the bit
; read counter. This variable is 0-based.
;
